# Student_Performance Analysis using different factors
I successfully completed a project focused on developing a predictive model for student performance based on a diverse set of academic and extracurricular factors. The dataset included information for 250 students with various columns such as Exam Scores, Attendance, Study Hours, Social Activity, Gender, Homework Completion, Tutoring Hours, Health Score, Extracurricular Activities, and Performance categories.

Approach:

Loaded the dataset into a pandas Data Frame and reviewed basic statistics.
Addressed missing values and performed data preprocessing.
Utilized visualization techniques to illustrate the impact of different factors on student performance.
Implemented a Random Forest classifier for training and prediction.

Results:

Achieved an accuracy of 84% in predicting student performance.
Conducted in-depth analyses, including a classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

Insights:

Identified correlations between study hours, attendance, and exam scores.
Explored the influence of health scores, social activity, and extracurricular activities on student performance.
